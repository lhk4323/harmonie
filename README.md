This is a reel page I'm designing for my SO. 

The purpose behind this design is a semi-responsive page that keeps the layout the same. It was also a test to use modal pop ups in order to launch a video player when a user clicks on the project name button.

The modal JS and CSS are not mine; I imported those and modified them to fit the needs for this site design.  

I planned on altering the design using CSS Grid to have the site layout go:

video 1 | description 1
description 2 | video 2
video 3 | description 3
etc. 

I also need to update the content. This is still in the works as we decide on what content we want to be added to the reel.
